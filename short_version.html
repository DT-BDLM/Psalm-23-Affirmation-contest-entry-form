            </header>

            <p>This is an inner realization of the kingdom of God. It is an inner experience of realization. The Reality, the Real-I-Live occurs as the words, the meaning of the words are repeated and known, held in the silence, in the thinking, the thoughts, the feelings, the words, actions, and reactions. The realization happens in a moment, in the twinkling of the eye. In that moment The Christ is Realized, the Real-I-Lives in You, as You.</p>

            <p>This Affirmation is inspired by the Holy Spirit and was written by **PASTOR DR. DENNIS L. WATERS** and has been shepherded to a great degree by Minister Vielka C. M. Waters.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center text-2xl md:text-3xl font-extrabold text-green-700">PSALM 23 AFFIRMATION</h2>
            <p>“So when they had come together, they asked him, ‘Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?’ He replied, ‘It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. ..’ When the day of Pentecost had come...All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit…” (Acts 1:6-8 and 2:1-4 NRSV)</p>

            <p>I have faith in God. I have faith in Spirit. I have faith in things Invisible.</p>

            <p>The Holy Spirit is upon me. The Holy Spirit has been poured into me! The Holy Spirit is within me. God’s Angels are all around me to deliver me. God’s Word is in me. I affirm God’s Word works in me as I affirm God’s Word.</p>

            <p>God’s Presence is remembered by me. God is the Omnipresence of the Universe. There is One God. God is all there is. God is One. One God, One Mind, One Intelligence, One Power, One Substance, Oneness. I dwell in Oneness. Oneness dwells in me. There is only One God.</p>

            <p>God is The Only Omnipotence. God is Individualized as me so I have God’s power and God’s ability to do His will.</p>

            <p>God’s Resources are my resources. I AM God’s Child. I AM God’s Offspring. I AM an heir of God. I receive Divine Ideas, Divine Wisdom, and Divine Intelligence. God has provided Himself and all that He has to me. All that the Father has is mine.</p>

            <p>God is working in my life, for my life, through my life and within me, to accomplish His will in this community and in the world. The Son of God, the Christ is in me, is through me, is as me, NOW! The Son of God is manifested in me now, made visible in my body and in all my affairs now. The Christ in me comes not to destroy the good but to fill full my Life, my Affairs, and my World with all Good, all God.</p>
            
            <p>I have faith in God. I have faith in Spirit. I have faith in things Invisible.</p>

            <h3>2. God Leads</h3>
            <p>God is my consciousness. God is Divine Mind. God is my Mind in me, through me, as me. Through my thinking God leads me, God guides me, God instructs me, God teaches me, God disciplines me, God directs me., God heals me and God corrects me. Through my thinking I receive Divine Ideas.</p>
            <p>God orders my steps. God directs my paths. God is within me. I have the power of God because Spirit is in me. I Am strong. I AM able. I AM confident. I AM competent. I AM courageous. I AM worthy. I AM dignified and definite, yet I AM meek and lowly. I AM the Ruler served by the Rule.</p>
            
            <p>I have faith in God. I have faith in Spirit. I have faith in things Invisible.</p>

            <h3>3. God Restores and Renews</h3>
            <p>God is within me. I remember my nature is the nature of God, my origin is God, and my purpose is God’s Purpose. I and my Father are One. I AM healed. I AM healthy. I know that I shall realize a good and blessed outcome and result in all things. I am realizing heaven on earth in my consciousness, in my thinking, thoughts, feelings, words, actions and reactions, right now.</p>
            <p>I AM enlightened. I AM encouraged. I AM empowered. I AM enriched. Today I AM Aware that I sit with Christ in my Consciousness in Heavenly Places in my mind. Today I AM consciously aware of my God Given Power to Chose to sit with the Christ in the condition and position of being in this world, but my thinking is not conformed to this world, for I know that I am a spiritual being existing in a human body.</p>
            <p>Today I let the Mind of Christ be in me, as I AM strengthened by the Renewal of My Mind, in my thinking, and empowered in my Being, by the Consciousness of Christ in Me. Today I renew my mind by the Words of God. I see God in revelation, I see God in Nature. I hear God in Revelation. I hear God in Nature. I see and hear God in me, through me, as me. I have the Mind of Christ. I have the Consciousness of Christ.</p>

            <p>God provides me not only with resources, He has also placed at my disposal some unique and special resources, that I handle with the wisdom and intelligence He has given to me. These special resources ensure the assistance of heavenly beings, enhance and guarantee the outcome according to God’s will, guarantee that God’s name will be glorified, that His nature will be revealed, that others will be blessed, and that all will receive special benefits.

            <h3>5. The Presence in the Present</h3>
            <p>God has built barriers around me that though I am in the midst of my enemies, they can see me, but they can not get to me. God has both insulated me and inoculated me. He has built a wall of protection around me and has placed another line of defense inside of me. God Himself is my Shield, my Defender, my Protector, my Champion, and my King. The Champion is in me. I AM the Champion.</p>
            <p>I AM aware that God is all there is and that In God I live and move and have my Being. I AM Aware that God is in me and that I AM in God. I AM Aware that where ever I AM, God is, for God is OmniPresence. Yes, there is only One God. All that is Real, Enduring, Truth and Everlasting is God. All else is a lie and is not real. There is only God. God is ALL.</p>
            <p>God is within me. Even in the tough and challenging moments of life, even in situations where it seems there is no way out, God is nourishing me and feeding me and building me up, making me stronger. God is rejuvenating me.</p>

I have the hope of glory. I am the hope of glory. I can do all things through Christ, He strengthens me. I AM strengthened by the Renewal of My Mind, in my thinking, and empowered in my Being, by the Consciousness of Christ in Me.</p>
