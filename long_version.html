            <p class="mt-4">
                This is an inner realization of the kingdom of God. It is an inner experience of realization. The Reality, the Real-I-Live occurs as the words, the meaning of the words are repeated and known, held in the silence, in the thinking, the thoughts, the feelings, the words, actions, and reactions. The realization happens in a moment, in the twinkling of the eye. In that moment The Christ is Realized, the Real-I-Lives in You, as You.

                This Affirmation is inspired by the Holy Spirit and was written by **PASTOR DR. DENNIS L. WATERS** and has been shepherded to a great degree by Minister Vielka C. M. Waters.

            <h3>The Promise</h3>
            <p>
                “So when they had come together, they asked him, ‘Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?’ He replied, ‘It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. ..’ When the day of Pentecost had come...All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit…” (Acts 1:6-8 and 2:1-4 NRSV)
