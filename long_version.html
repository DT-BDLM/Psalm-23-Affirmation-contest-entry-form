            <!-- Section 1: Treasure in Trash -->
            <h2 id="treasure-in-trash">1. Treasure in Trash</h2>
            <p>My wife shops in consignment stores, at yard sales, and dollar stores. Occasionally she comes home to relate she saw something valuable in someone's trash by the side of the road. One day, she saw a dull looking, light green, nine drawer dresser by the side of the road. Stopping the car, getting out, she examined it. It was made of wood, with detail engravings, eight of the nine drawers were present, and the drawers had beautiful detail designs on their handles.</p>
            <p>Convinced of its quality, she came home to get help to bring it from the place where it was, the trash heap, into a new place, our home. Two willing sons assisted her.</p>
            <p>In our home, the dresser had new surroundings. It was no longer exposed to the elements, no longer doomed to destruction. It did not match the furniture in our home, nor was it ready for display. Still it now belonged to us, it had been redeemed.</p>
            <p>After getting this dresser in our home, my wife constantly implored me to refinish it. Constantly she implied she was going to refinish it herself. Yet for months the dresser remained in our home untouched. Redeemed from the trash, yes, but untouched.</p>
            <p>Finally, one day we purchased some furniture stripper, steel wool, sand paper, and other tools to begin the refinishing process. We put the stripper on, waited a period of time, according to the directions, then scraped it off. This removed the first layer of green paint. Next, using the steel wool we removed the paint in the very grain of the wood. Then we used the sand paper to complete the removal of the old green paint.</p>
            <p>With the old green paint removed, the dresser's true beauty was revealed. We realized this dresser was built with at least two purposes. Not only did it have a utilitarian purpose, to hold things, it also had an aesthetic purpose, to beautify a room.</p>
            <p>Desiring to both protect and preserve the now revealed beauty, we choose a polyurethane coating and a varnish stain to now coat it with.</p>
            <p>Today we have a beautiful treasure in our home. There are still only eight drawers in the dresser. When we stop and consider its beauty and its usefulness we may be tempted to forget where we found it. But every time we focus on the missing drawer, we are reminded that it was a treasure found in the trash.</p>
            <p>Salvation is a salvage operation, planned in heaven and executed on earth. In the Bible, the operation's manual for the rescue efforts, the lost, are depicted in a number of ways, They are the fallen, the separated, the weak, the impotent, those without strength, enemies of God, the guilty, the blind, and the enfeebled, to name a few. On the other hand, the saved are the risen, the reconciled, the strong in Christ, the powerful, the justified, mends of God, the acquitted, the one who see, and the empowered and enabled. The metaphors are many. One metaphor favored by Jesus refers to the condition of the lost and saved as those who are citizens in one kingdom or another.</p>
            <p>In Luke 17, Jesus said, "The kingdom of God, cometh not with observation ...The kingdom of God is within you." In John 3, in his conversation with Nicodemus, he speaks of a kingdom that a person must be born again of the spirit to see and to enter.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Paul in the book of Ephesians speaks of a spiritual kingdom. The kingdom he speaks of is the antagonist to the kingdom of heaven referred to by Jesus. In Ephesians 6 he says, We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."</p>
            <p>The two spiritual kingdoms are world wide. The ruler of the spiritual kingdom of God on earth is Jesus Christ. He is called the Prince of peace. He is given a name above every other name, that at His name every knee should bow and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>
            <p>The ruler of the other world wide spiritual kingdom is satan, he is called the prince of the power of the air, or the prince of this world, or the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</p>
            <p>The Gospel, the Good News is the fact that we have a choice between the two kingdoms. We can choose whether we will be in the kingdom of the Prince, or of a prince. The choice we have is a direct result of the life, death, resurrection and ministry of Jesus Christ. Because of Jesus Christ every individual receives a resurrection, a new chance to decide, to determine which prince and which kingdom they will give their allegiance to. The Good News is the fact that we can choose. No matter what choice we make, we still can rejoice in the fact that God did not make us heavenly remote control androids, or a D.A. T. A. with feelings. Through the blood of Jesus Christ, as in Adam all die, so in Christ, shall all be made alive. The day will come when all shall hear His voice and shall come forth. The Gospel, the Good News that is not dependent in anyway upon which kingdom we choose--- is the fact that because of the life of ministry, and the sacrificial death, burial, resurrection, and intercession of Jesus Christ we have a choice of kingdoms. Praise God.</p>
            <p>God's desire is to have the Good News, the everlasting Gospel of His Nature and His Activity to provide this choice proclaimed to every person. After hearing the Gospel, the first step in the experiencing of salvation is making the right choice. That is to choose Christ as King of your life, and to choose His Kingdom. Jesus said that making this choice is to be our first and only priority in life, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness ..." There is never a mention of seeking anything second or third. "Seek first" means "seek only." Every thing else is added once we have found the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>What happens when a person chooses Christ and His Kingdom? To understand this we need to understand more, or define more succinctly what comprises a spiritual kingdom.</p>
            <p>A kingdom is comprised of five elements:</p>
            <p>1. WORLDVIEW: Worldview is the prism through which a culture of people view the world. The things of the spirit are seen from the inside.</p>
            <p>Worldview is what is on the inside of the person, so that when the person looks out, the person looks from the inside out, and describes not what is on the outside, but what is on the inside.</p>
            <p>2. VALUE SYSTEM by our value system the culture of people determine what is worth living, or dying, or working, or sacrificing for. The Value System also places value upon people.</p>
            <p>3. There is a SPIRIT to each culture, this spirit is the camaraderie of the overall culture.</p>
            <p>4. Each culture has a CODE OF BEHAVIOR, or a code of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.</p>
            <p>5. In every kingdom there is REWARDS AND PUNISHMENT.</p>
            <p>We are born in a world where all individuals are touched by the worldview, values, religion acceptance criterion, and system of reward and punishment of the kingdom of satan. Selfishness is the attitude of looking out for number 1. It is the syndrome of "Me First, Me Only," of "What's in it for Me?" This syndrome affects every aspect of our lives and every life.</p>
            <p>When born into the world of sin, the worldview, values, the religion, the acceptance criterion, the system of reward and punishment are primarily outside of us. We are in other words in the trash, born in sin, dead in trespasses and sin. As we live the elements of the kingdom of satan are modeled before us. However as time passes we cultivate and internalize these elements. The degree we cultivate and internalize these elements determines the degree that satan's kingdom is inside of us, and the degree that we are inside of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>When a person accepts Christ as Savior and Prince which is to say, when the person is born again, is justified by faith, there are two things that happens. The first is that the person's citizenship is changed. Being born again brings the person, plants the individual in a new environment. There are now different influences that surround the individual. The individual's citizenship and location is changed. Their names are written in the Lamb's book of life, the citizenship registry of heaven. Next the first installment, principle, seed, thought of the kingdom of God is planted in the individual. God gives a new heart, new motives, new desires, new purposes to the person. Christ is now enthroned in the heart. A new Spirit is given, a new attitude. The Word that is now listen to, acted upon, and responded to, changes. The individual is also equipped with internal Holy Spirit inspired resources to help the individual live a life in harmony with their new country. This setting of the person into the kingdom of God is an act of pure grace on the part of God. It is the receiving of this grace through faith by the individual that makes this grace operative in the individuals life. Praise God for his grace! Praise God for His Love! Praise God for giving you a choice of kings and kingdoms!</p>
            <p>Further, when a person is born again, truly having accepted Christ, the person is planted in God's kingdom, and God's kingdom is planted in them, it is important to understand at least two things.</p>
            <p>One, the person is in the kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom of life, salvation and liberty. This means that like the old dresser the person is now in the house. The person is no longer exposed to the influences that controlled them previously. The person is no longer doomed for destruction. The person is redeemed, rescued, in the house, in the kingdom. Even if for days/months/years the person is untouched, if the seed lies dormant for a period of time, the person is still in the kingdom. Which means that their eternal destiny is fixed. If the person dies in the kingdom of Christ, they die in the Lord, and are assured of being in the first resurrection.</p>
            <p>Praise God. The next item is that the remnants of satan's kingdom, which the Bible calls strongholds and imaginations that exalt themselves above the knowledge of God, or which can be see as the old things, or as old attitudes, values, behavior, etc., still are in the individual. Christianity is not magic, but mystery. God has planted His kingdom in a seed form, a small principle, or ideal in the individual. Now the seed of Christ's kingdom, His worldview, His value system, His Spirit, His actions, His reward, will filter out, or take ground inside the mind/heart/spirit of the individual. In other words the dresser is in the house, but the paint is still on it, which means that the new coating has not been put on. As the old is removed it is replaced by the new. A time consuming and very careful and cooperative stage, between God and the individual.</p>
            <p>So it is to be a citizen of the New Kingdom. Rejoice we have a choice! Christ, our King, first brings us into His kingdom, into a relationship with Himself Rejoice we have a relationship with the King! Then He strips us of the old worldview, values, spirit, love, and rules of life. Rejoice in the Wash! He then refinishes us, re-clothes us with the beautiful stain of His attributes and character. Rejoice we are refined, and refinished! There are still some things that remind us of where we came ITom, but praise God one day the great Dresser Maker of Eternity, will indeed make all things new, and in that day, this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and the old dresser of our lives, will have all of the drawers.</p>
            <p>Rejoice we have a Blessed Hope!</p>

            <p>The satan inspired world view</p>
            <p>The Christ inspired world view</p>
            <p>I was born unlucky (or lucky)</p>
            <p>God has had His hand on me all my life, even when I did not see it</p>
            <p>I become bitter when one of my goals is ftustrated</p>
            <p>In my setbacks, I reckon on God bringing a greater good than I could have known otherwise</p>
            <p>I am what I have been, my history is my future.</p>
            <p>I am what I will be, my present is determined by my future.</p>
            <p>My life is controlled by and measured the physical, sex, food, money, position</p>
            <p>I believe that the spiritual is greater than and in control of the physical</p>
            <p>My goal is the pursuit of moments of satisfaction/temporary gratification</p>
            <p>My goal is to live my life on a a continuum of joy. God is in control, my present is a captive of my ''blessed hope"</p>
            <p>My life is characterized by self-discipline. Self is the major consideration, even if it means delaying gratification, if self ultimately benefits.</p>
            <p>My life is dominated by love. God's love for me and the world, my love for God and for others</p>
            <p>My life is lived on linear time, chronos, one moments follows the next, I live for next high, sexual encounter, business success, victory, etc.</p>
            <p>My life is lived on God's time, God will do it in His time, at just the right moment He will make it happen and let it happen</p>
            <p>Satan's kingdom concerns itself with behavior, or what the Bible calls in Gal. 5: 19ff, the works of the flesh. Christ's kingdom concerns itself with the ftuit or internal and eternal end result of our behavior.</p>
            <p>In Satan's kingdom all must act right to be accepted. In Christ's kingdom you are accepted.</p>
            <p>In Satan's kingdom you are rewarded based on performance. In Christ's kingdom, you are given Christ's reward, based on His performance. His reward is with Him. It is His reward that He shares with us.</p>
            <p>In Satan's kingdom the living will die, to live, to die again. In Christ's kingdom the dead, live life (zoe) never to die.</p>
            <p>satan's kingdom concerns itself with time, Christ's kingdom concerns itself with eternity.</p>

            <!-- Section 2: A Way Out of the Trash -->
            <h2 id="a-way-out-of-the-trash-2">2. A Way Out of the Trash</h2>
            <p>Last evening, after a conversation that stung me at a depth and level that I had not recently been stung, or that I had not allowed myself to be stung, or hurt at, for quite some time, I rewrote some of the elements of Treasure in Trash that I am looking for. Here is what I wrote:</p>
            <p>In the story Treasure in Trash the question that I am seeking to answer is, How does a person who senses either that they are a treasure or that they have a treasure inside of them, get out of a trash like situation, or when necessary get the trash out of them, when that is the case? This is really the question of what can you do about your own situation. I have had for a bit of time a statement that says, If you see the need for change, you need to change. There is another item that I say that says, Change your words, change your life. Additionally, one of the sayings that comes out of my religious training is that we are seeking to make God known by our thoughts, attitudes, words and actions (TAWA). This thought when added to the major teaching of the law of attraction, which in my estimation is that we create our world by virtue of our thoughts, words, emotions, which then leads to our actions, brings forth what I am really seeking to do. What is it that I am seeking to do? Really, I am seeking to empower people, any people, any person and every person, to be agents of change in their own lives and in the world. I am seeking to say that change occurs first at the level of an idea, a thought. Even when you are in the trash, or even when the trash is in you, you can change everything by thinking outside the trash, or thinking of yourself as outside the trash. So the first thing to bring about change is to consider how life could be different, and to hold this thought of how life could be long enough and with enough intensity that it affects your attitudes, your words, your emotions, and your actions. This will then bring about a change in your life. You will be out of the trash.</p>
            <p>Again, here is what I wrote: At this present moment my life feels like it is in the trash, like Im in the trash, and it may be that there is much trash inside of me.</p>
            <p>My finances are in the trash. In the past three years my life has simply unraveled on almost every level. My finances are in the trash. Each time, it seems, that I have tried to make an investment, and have something turn out for good, something has occurred that has countered the situation. Have you ever heard the statement, You take one step forward and then two steps backwards? At first it may seem that it is to turn out right, but then there is some detail that comes up and unravels everything.</p>
            <p>For me it has been purchasing investment property, the managing of a Gospel concert, sending materials and supplies to Kenya, the publishing of my book, I Will Restore, helping an individual with their business, the difficulties of my marriage, the sickness and near death of my wife, and my work as a pastor. Really in the years that have occurred to some degree after the writing of my book, and then in a more intense way, since my visit to Egypt and Kenya, Africa. All of these items seem to be going in or have already gone into a trash-like condition. How do I get out of this trash-like situation? In the story Treasure in Trash the dresser is in the trash. Lets say that we personify the dresser, that is we make the dresser to represent a person. In the story it is taken out of the trash by someone else. But lets say, no help has come for me, there is no knight in shining armor, the cavalry does not come just in time, the hero does not come from the outside. Lets say that the hero must be found within. Is it possible to get ones self out of the trash?</p>
            <p>Perhaps the one bright spot for all this is the law of attraction. The law of attraction is this concept that I can create my world by virtue of my thoughts, words and emotions. In thinking of the law of attraction or religious science, or the science of the mind, the difficult pill to swallow is the one that says the reason all of the things that have happened to me have happened to me, is because of some faulty flawed, stinkin thinkin in the first place. This is hard because as much as I have searched, what I come up with is really in a universe of cause and effect, I walk away like Jeremiah, It is truly of the Lords mercies that I am not consumed. It is truly because of His compassions fail not, and that they are new every morning. Gods faithfulness truly is great.</p>
            <p>When I consider from what may have been birth to now, it seems that I have made bad decision after bad decision. What is so astounding is that I always had good reasons for making bad decisions. Often times I was simply reacting, not responding, to things may have been happening externally to me, but they were pushing internal buttons. I blamed, felt justified, got angry, and everything in between. Hence Im in the trash and it is because of all the trash that is inside of me.</p>
            <p>How did the trash get inside of me? It depends on what belief system I adhere to. Do I believe in the total human depravity? I was born in sin and shapen in iniquity. Or is it I have gone astray from birth. Or am I the prodigal who born into the family, the human family, Gods image family, who then went off to the pig pen of life? Perhaps it is simply all of the above and more. What about conspiracy theories? What about the sequalae of my upbringing and abuse?</p>
            <p>There are so many reasons and theories of how one gets in the trash, of how one gets messed up in life, yet the truth of the matter is that this is all secondary to what I am seeking. My primary concern is really, How do I get out of the trash? How does a person get out of the trash, no matter how they got into the trash to begin with?</p>
            <p>The Bible says, If my people who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, pray, seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I (God) will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land. There is so much sin and wicked ways I need to turn from. Is perfection of a human being required? Or can I be covered by the blood of Jesus?</p>
            <p>Is it my thoughts that have attracted to me the things that I have now, or the conditions and circumstances of my life and environment? Then if that is the case then what I really want to do is to think differently. I want to renew my mind, be transformed in my thinking.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the first thing is to adopt a world view that causes me to know and believe that regardless of what is happening now, that I have already overcome the world by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ. I do believe that in the end I win. In the end we win. That is why we are winning now.</p>
            <p>What is it that is happening now? Recently I have reflected on the Bible verse that says, Be still and know that I am God. At one point as I reflected on this verse, a crucifix was before me. What a profound revelation! Stop the struggle, the fight, against God. Even in a cross-like (How much more in the trash can you be than when you are in a cross-like situation), even when it seems that what is happening to you is unjustified, Be still --- and know, horizontally and vertically, that is wide, high and deep, plumb the depths, on every level of experience, God is God. I must get still enough, I must stop fighting God, no matter what is happening, God is God.</p>
            <p>I must be faced with circumstances that sometimes are so overwhelming, so trauma inducing, that I am still, until by Being is still. It is then that I will choose to know that God is God.</p>
            <p>This is where I am. Only God can move me beyond what is taking place in my life.</p>
            <p>Next, God is both outside of me and inside of me. Christ within, the kingdom of God within, the Holy Spirit within, is the next thought that moves me beyond the trash. This is such a wonderful thought, it requires its own development. I will leave this for later.</p>
            <p>Thankfulness, gratitude, is another thought. Again the text says, In everything, not for, but in everything give thanks. I can and will give thanks. This is Gods will. One statement that I have been given by God and for which I am most thankful, is the one that says, The most thankful are the most thankful. People who are the most thankful for what they already have both in fact and in faith, receive more for which they are even more thankful. Truly I can enter His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise. I can be thankful, that this is the day that God has made. It is a day that I can rejoice and be glad to be alive. In every situation, I can rest assured of the love of God, the forgiveness of God, the protection of God, the provisions of God, and the presence of God. He promised that He will never leave me nor forsake me. So rather than focusing on all that is not, I can look again at what is. God is. God is the great I AM of my life. It does not matter if I am, or you are in the trash. God is. There is hope.</p>
            <p>Even in this situation, I can have hope. I can have faith in God. I can have faith and hope both for this world and that things can change, and also have faith and hope for the world to come. First I believe that times will get better. I believe that the epithet of this will be that it came to pass. I also believe that this world will one day yield to another world. In this situation I can still pray in faith, speak in faith, and act in faith. In this situation I can still read of and dream of a country called heaven, with a capital city called, New Jerusalem. In this situation even in the trash, I can still value the treasure, my ability as a human being to think above and beyond my situation. Yes, I can apply the stripper of repentance for decisions I have made in the past, which coated over and stained me, so that my true beauty and purpose were hidden. I can apply the scrapper and steel wool of confession of specific sins. I can even apply the sand paper of forgiving both myself, God and others, and asking for forgiveness of others for the many things I have done wrong. Then after this I can fortify my spirit, my mind and have the mind, the thoughts of God, the mind of Christ, by hiding the Word of God in my heart, my mind, that I might live a life pleasing to God.</p>
            <p>Such as, God said that with every temptation, He would make a way of escape. God said that He would not tempt us above what we are able to bear God said, He would never leave us nor forsake us. God said that I can do all things through Christ</p>
            <p>God has so many promises in His word and all for them can be hidden by me in my mind/heart, so that rather than having my own mind, my own thoughts about whatever it is that I am going through, I have the mind of Christ, the thoughts of Christ, the perspective of Christ. Then as I think like Christ, I begin to have the attitude of Christ, the emotions of Christ, the words of Christ, and begin to do the works of Christ, and as I do this, I bring forth the results according to the will of God. In this way, I attract to myself, the good and positive will of God.</p>
            <p>This then is something of what I had in mind. I believe it combines the law of attraction with the teachings of the Bible, and brings forth how an individual can effect change in their own life.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: The Tunnel -->
            <h2 id="the-tunnel-2">3. The Tunnel</h2>
            <p>A Meditation: A Re-Mind-ing</p>
            <p>My sister, Hattie Marie Waters, was five years older than me, and five grades ahead of me in school, as far as I know, walked with me to school on my first day. She took me to Mrs. Edwards first grade classroom at Greenleaf Elementary School and left me. As she turned to leave, I remember her telling me to stay in that classroom. She said she would come back to get me when it was time to go home.</p>
            <p>When the class day was done, true to her word, she left her sixth grade classroom and came downstairs. I was in the classroom and pretty much in the same spot she left me.</p>
            <p>While Hattie was near, as long as I had her hand to hold, as long as she came back, as long as I had her promise of return, I did not consciously pay close attention to where I was walking, or even to where we were going. I know now that subconsciously I noted where were going, the roads we took, the short cuts, walking through the tunnel, noting the times when the eight lights were all in and all on, when some were in but out, when all were all out, thought they were in, and when they were all out, and therefore all out, because someone had thrown rocks, breaking them, and they were not working, they were all out and out.</p>
            <p>When the lights were all out, the tunnel was dark. I could barely see through it, from one side to the other. It was only about one hundred feet long, perhaps one hundred fifty feet, a mere ten to fifteen yards. Overhead was a four lane high way, which when Hattie was in a hurry, she would take the short cut, the most direct route, grabbing me by the hand, she would look both ways, and we would run, across the lanes without going through the tunnel.</p>
            <p>Highway 117 overpass it was called. Hattie said that going home via this short cut was dangerous, we could get hit by a car, and that since I was just six years old, I should never attempt to do this, except when she was with me, and that she would always be with me, and she was, and most of the time we took the long way through the tunnel.</p>
            <p>When we could see through the tunnel we could not see what, or who, lurched on the side of the tunnel. Some times when we were about to emerge we heard voices, people, other children, hiding, ready to throw rocks at those who came through. But I never had to worry about this. I was six, Hattie was almost twelve, she held my hand, she always came back to get me, we took the long way through the tunnel. I was safe, protected.</p>
            <p>One day it happened, I waited in my classroom. I waited and waited. Mrs. Edwards told me to go up the stairs to the sixth graders classroom. I had never been upstairs before so she gave me clear, explicit instructions. I was still a bit afraid. You know how it is when you are going some place where you have not been before. Dont you? Yet I was in school, so I walked out of my class, down the long dimly lit hallway, went through the double doors that I had never gone through before, went up the stairs, knocked on the door of the sixth graders classroom. The teacher said, Come in. I did. I asked her about my sister, Hattie. The teacher said she left about an hour ago.</p>
            <p>I was afraid. I thought, she must have forgotten me. If she goes home without me, mama will tell her to come back to get me. In 1958 we did not have a telephone in the house, as a matter of fact I dont remember anyone, on my street, having a telephone in the house, so I could not call home. I dont recall the school having a phone either. I simply thought Hattie was coming back. After a while Mrs. Edwards said she was going home. She said I had to go home by myself. I was afraid.</p>
            <p>It was then that I became consciously aware of all my fears, my doubts, my uncertainties. I was scared, unclear, unsure, alone. But I knew I could not stay at school, nor did I want to. I wanted to go home. Home for me, down John Street, then turn left, follow the long path to the tunnel, go through the tunnel, turn to the left on Claudia Ave, pick up John Street again, on the right, pass the house on the corner, go to Marion Street, pass Mr. Charleys house, (Mr. Charley would not give us our balls that fell in his yard, when as we were playing stick ball in the street, they sometimes flew in his yard.), turn to the right at Marion Street, go to my home where my mother was, where I thought my sister was, at our home in the middle of the Marion Street.</p>
            <p>It was about three oclock in the afternoon, the sun was shining, the streets were bright. I walked down John Street, turned to the left, followed the long cut path to the tunnel. Got to the tunnel, looked in. It was dark. Every light was outOUT! I could not see through the tunnel. In my mind I wondered if some of the children, who lived around the corner from me, and who liked to fight those of us who lived on Marion Street, were waiting on the sides of the tunnel, waiting for me to emerge from the tunnel, waiting to jump on me, waiting to throw rocks at me, waiting to hurt me. I felt I was alone that day.</p>
            <p>This dark tunnel stood between me and home, between me and my destination, between me and my ideal place to be. This dark tunnel, within which were all the boogey men that I had ever heard of, all the trolls, hiding in the tunnel, under the overhead highway.</p>
            <p>I could not go back to school, it was closed, empty. I could cross the four lane highway. It was more dangerous, and I risked getting hit by a car. What would you as a six year old do? In 1958? When you had not crossed the highway nor gone through the tunnel, alone, before?</p>
            <p>Dr. Ernest Holmes, in his book, This Thing Called YOU, in the second chapter relates two stories which tell us that we have all been and maybe still are, this six year old, who is faced with the decision of whether or not to go through the dark, the unknown, of the tunnel, in order to get home, the place where you truly live.</p>
            <p>In one description he says this is viewed as a line. At one end is where you currently are, your physical environment, your location, physically, mentally, emotionally, and all the other reference points you use to know you and where you are. At the other end of the line is your spiritual being, God, your infinite possibilities. At this end everything is already perfect, worked out. It is the place that Jesus described as, The kingdom of heaven, that is even now, being proclaimed as having come to the earth. This kingdom wants to come into your life, be your life, you be in it. Your spirit is your happiness, your wholeness, your freedom, your joy, your fulfillment, your eternal existence. All your highest hopes, your greatest dreams, come from what is on the other end of the line. This other end of the line echoes to you in your intellect, it speaks an unspoken word in your mind, its light and life, shine in your heart, your imagination, and moves you to desire it in your soul. Do you see the other side of the line? Can you describe it? Is it clear to you? Do you have clarity of what you see beyond where you are today?</p>
            <p>But you are on this side of the line, your physical environment is here, your body is here, most of your conscious thoughts are here, your daily hopes and aspirations here, your fears, are also here, your failures are also here, and your doubts are all here.</p>
            <p>You are here. You start, then stop. You climb the mountains, you ford the streams, you get lost in the forest, searching, wondering, hoping, longing, yearning, to get to the other side of the line, to be whole, complete, fulfilled. One foot in heaven, in contemplation, of the sweet kingdom of heaven, and the other foot firmly planted in all your fears, failures, doubts, and cares. Which side of this line are you on, in your mind?</p>
            <p>His next illustration is that of a tunnel. At one end of this tunnel there are fertile valleys, glorious sunshine, verdant vegetation. There is song, laughter, happiness, peace and joy.</p>
            <p>You are at the other end in a deep, dark cave, overlooking a desert, through which no refreshing streams flow.</p>
            <p>You have caught a glimpse of home, and you know you can reach home while it is yet day, you know you do not have to wait for the night, you have caught a glimpse, had a sensing of what is on the other side of the tunnel. Every now and then, a shaft of illumination has reached the darkness of your mind, your cave, and you have caught a vision of light on the other side. You look beyond the dismal scene of you discontent and unhappiness, through the tunnel, through the darkness, and you long to enter into the joy that the vision has revealed to you.</p>
            <p>Then the darkness closes in, your vision vanishes, you think it must have been your imagination, running you. You now hear two voices. One says, Its an illusion, a mirage. Its not real. Its not for you. Its for them, others, just not for you. Accept things the way they are. Its not that bad. Be happy here. This is the best it will ever be. Settle for this. This is the voice of despair. This is the voice of fear.</p>
            <p>The second voice says, Do not be afraid. What you saw is Reality. Your sight has been restored, your mind has been restored, and your Reality has been restored. It has always been. It will always be. You were blind, now you see. You were asleep, you woke up. Stay awake! Dont go back to sleep! Enter the tunnel. Walk through the tunnel. There is nothing solid in the tunnel, no boogey men, your fears are un-real, they are vapors, misty, wispy, vapors of unbelief. The only thing dense in the tunnel is doubt. There is a light within you, a voice within you, a courage within you, a feeling within you, a knowing wisdom, walk through the tunnel. The darkness of doubt will be dispelled by the light of your vision, on the other side is your true home. Walk through!</p>
            <p>That day to get home I chose to walk through that dark tunnel. As I took each step, I could almost sense what Hattie had taught me, the lessons, the thoughts, the sense that there was a presence with me, the light at the end, and the fact that to get home, I had to pass through this tunnel, all drew me to the other side. Yet even more, somewhere in my mind, I thought Hattie was somewhere watching over me, ready to come if I needed her. But I felt she was hoping that the six year old first grader on the first step of what he thought was a twelve step ladder, had learned the lessons she had been teaching from the first day of school, her school, with the lesson entitled, The Tunnel.</p>
            <p>That day, and every day since, I have had to face the fears, the doubts, and the uncertainties of the dark places in life. And yes, there have been times when I have had to walk alone. My sister Hattie left me again about six years after this. She was in the twelfth grade of high school. She would have been the first of my parents children to get a high school diploma. But before she could finish she transitioned to life after life.</p>
            <p>One day a bit later I had to go through another tunnel, to get a high school diploma, I had to leave the familiar streets of my community , move from the city to the farm, away from the incessant activity to the peace and quiet of nights under the stars. It was another tunnel. On the other side a high school diploma. My mind caught a vision of college, and beyond. Walking through the tunnel meant turning pages of book that none of my friends in the city had ever heard of, at the time participating in the integration of a rural school and all the shoving, name calling, looks and the fight that went along with this. Graduation from high school, then going to college meant, joining the army, remaining in for three years, getting an honorable discharge, getting the VA school benefits, enrolling in and then finishing college.</p>
            <p>Today I say that I have gone through many tunnels. Truthfully the process is always the same especially the major details, with slight nuances of difference.</p>
            <p>Yet Im still walking through tunnels. Many times Im looking for others to walk with me. Yet I know the journey is mine and that there is a stretch in the tunnel that one must walk alone. Often when the lights are out, the tunnel is dark and the vapors of fears, failures, doubts and uncertainties seem real, and dense and hard, it is hard to realize the un-reality of these misty visitors. Yet on the other side of every tunnel there is a vision of something more, something better, something more real. This vision is real. The fears are vapors. Walk through, the voice inside me says, Walk Through.</p>
            <p>Dr Ernest Holmes says there is a great thing within you which can decide, determine your destiny, that can get you through the tunnels of life, can move you into your destiny, your dreams, your 4-D Life, your kingdom of heaven life within you life, so that you carry it with you, like a light in all situations. This thing that is within you, is your will, your ability to make a choice.</p>
            <p>What about it complaining caterpillar, will you choose to walk through the tunnel process to become the butterfly?</p>
            <p>What about it angry acorn, will you grow, in the tunnel process and through the tunnel process become the oak tree?</p>
            <p>What about you, will you decide to walk through your mental blocks? You have a vision, right? You must have a vision, you have read this far, and I know that you are going through the tunnel. You are going to live your 4-D Life.</p>
            <p>You sense the presence of God with you. You allow your vision to light your pathway through the darkness of doubt and fear. You have chosen to go forward, to move beyond your deserts of despair, and to not be discouraged by having to climb over high mountains of seeming sadness, to ford every stream, to follow every rainbow until you reach the other side of the tunnel. You are almost there. How brave, courageous, and wonderful you are. Congratulations. You made it to the end of this article, and to beginning of your life.</p>

            <!-- Section 4: An Invitation To Transformation -->
            <h2 id="an-invitation-to-transformation">4. An Invitation To Transformation</h2>
            <p>This article represents a revelation that came to me recently. At first I expressed it to only one person. Next, I was participating in a camp at Peak Potentials and I was impressed to share it with the community, the family, the people. When I finished speaking, one of the persons assigned to assist me in my spiritual/mental growth and development, asked me to put on paper what I said. This is what this is.</p>
            <p>There are two suppositions, beliefs, ideas that must be taken as absolute to understand this revelation: 1. Everything is energy. Everything in this Universe is either energy in a form, which we call matter, things, people, animals, nature, etc, or it is energy without form, which we speak of as waves/rays: light waves, X-rays, heat waves, radio waves, etc. Everything is energy. You are an energetic being, a being at a certain vibration. Animals, fish are energetic beings. A tree is energy in a form. 2. In a closed system, like this earth, energy can not be created, nor destroyed.</p>
            <p>My father loved to fish. A cane pole, a line on the pole, bait beneath the water, a bobbing cork on the water, sitting on a bucket by a river/lake, this was my fathers idea of heaven on earth. He could sit for hours, watching a cork bobbing, floating. Most times he had three poles, three lines in the water, three pieces of bait in the water, three corks on the water, all anchored on the shore.</p>
            <p>When daddy saw a cork go under, then come back up, or saw one move in an intentional manner, he said, got a nibble. As he ever so gently eased the pole into his hands, he made sure he did not disturb the nibbling fish. He had bait on the line and now the fish was accepting his invitation to transformation. At just the right moment, daddy would pull on the line, got him!!! he would yell. When he pulled the big one from the water, a big smile would spread on his face, as he proudly displaced his catch.</p>
            <p>I have always wondered what was in fishing for the fish. Even as I have watched movies such as Lion King, Pocahontas and recently the blockbuster hit, Avatar, there were times when it simply did not come together for me. After all there is much that the eyes see and the mind misses. After all I am a trained, doctoral degree possessing, preacher, theologian. I have been educated in some of the best schools, (in my estimation), and trained by some of the best theologians (again in my estimation). Today I realize that it is when one graduates, not simply from the school, or with the degree, that your education commences, or in my case that my education, commenced. In other words it is only when one has the education that one is truly prepared to see, to know. Only those who see, see. When I take my education in a certain way, I could actually have been educated to discount and explain away things that are clearly evident in nature and that are spoken of in so many sacred book.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you can understand why it was easy for me to think that the only benefactor from the fish taking the bait and being caught was the fisherman. For me it is easy to think that the only one who benefits is stronger species who extends the invitation, and not the weaker species who accepts the invitation to transformation. After all only the strong survive. The weak die.</p>
            <p>So the fish is caught. It is cleaned. It is eater. The end.</p>
            <p>The End, Yes, the End. That is it was the end, until I understood that commencement starts when you finish. That is until I heard again, what I heard before, everything is energy, everything in the Universe, that which appears solid, and that which flows, everything is energy. Everything, the fish, the birds, the animals, the cattle, the sheep, the trees, the flowers, and yes the people. And, in a closed system, energy cannot be created, nor destroyed. Energy can only be transformed, moved from one form to another form.</p>
            <p>Remember the statement of Neytiri in Avatar You are like a baby. You see nothing. Then remember at the end, just before she says you are ready. She says, a clean kill. And do you remember what made it a clean kill? Or do you now understand, what makes it in the case of a fish a clean catch. Perhaps now you understand the title, An Invitation to Transformation.</p>
            <p>When my eyes opened, I began to see this vision of truth everywhere. I saw it in ripen fruit, in fallen leaves, in seasons of the year. For the first time, I know what it means that nature waste nothing, or that nature is so efficient. When I opened my eyes, sadness vanished and possibilities were endless. When I opened my eyes, the Bible made sense and the Universal Laws aligned.</p>
            <p>As I sat in a session, which is a part of the training to develop the vibratory level of thought that is necessary to be a millionaire, conducted by Peak Potentials, a company founded by T. Harv Eker, I thought of the many processes that I had already gone through. I thought of the may subconscious mind fricks that were hidden, out of my consciousness, that had surfaced I the past few months leading up to that moment. I now understood that all wealth is within. I now understood that to receive wealth from without, to manifest the wealth so that it is see-able in this world, the person who is manifesting, must connect, align in such a way that they are able to see that the wealth is everywhere, in everything and in everybody, including in them.</p>
            <p>What a revelation to me it has been to realize that the desire to possess a million dollars, and the promise of training to earn a million dollars, was simply the bait. The desire to possess a million dollars, and the promise of the training is simply An Invitation to Transformation.</p>
            <p>Later that day, my family and I ate the fish daddy caught. This fish became the energy for the adults to work and the children to play. In its own way it contributed to making me into the person that I have become today, a degreed theologian, an author, a preacher, a teacher, a trainer of others. So it is with much gratitude that I recognize today that truly this divine energy that flows through me is nurtured, sustained by the energy of this world, of this Universe.</p>
            <p>It is also with deep gratitude that I acknowledge that I have finally found something and someone that I believe in, and that made enough sense to my conscious mind, that I felt and still feel compelled to take the bait, to accept the Invitation to Transformation. Yes, I have transformed, and I am being transformed. Im learning again what I already know, yet learning it, being trained in my heart, on a cellular level to live what before was only in my head. There is a difference in me. I like the me that is different. As a result of accepting the Invitation to Transformation I forgiven people who Id forgiven before, Ive released things that Id released before. Ive found ways to get over, through and beyond situations and circumstances that previously imprisoned me, blocked me, and enslaved me. As a result of accepting the invitation to transformation Ive learned to walk forward into, or walk over that which I feared, because I now realize that my goal, my intention, my fulfilled desire, lies on the other side of that fear, and it is so important to me that it wills me forward, so much so that even my fears bow and bend to move out of the way to allow me to unite with my intention.</p>
            <p>As a result of accepting the Invitation to Transformation it is now easier to see how the secret to the million dollars is really in the thinking, in the MIND, and how it is that the Mind locked inside of itself, hides from consciousness, the wealth that the Universe, the Divine, has stored in each person, in you and in me. What has become clearer is that in order to manifest the millions, the Mind of Millionaire must be manifested, and that in order to manifest the MIND of the Millionaire, your Mind, must be MINED, and that in order to MINE the MIND of the Millionaire, you must accept the Invitation to Transformation.</p>
            <p>You have just received an invitation to transformation. Since you understand this at the level of Spirit/MIND, you are invited to take the next step. Your transformation begins now. Your transformation begins here.</p>

Waters, Sr. To accept this Invitation to Transformation to move forward in becoming the person that you were destined to be, to live the 4-D Life, on the dimension of Spirit/Mind, email him at dennis.waters4@comcast.net.

            <p>The Restoration Doctors mission is to give you the prescription that you need to birth, give life to, to implement in your life, what ever will ignite within you a willingness, desire, and determination to live your desired, divine destiny.</p>
            <p>Examples of Treasure that have been found in trash,</p>
            <p>1. The Dresser found by my wife.</p>
            <p>2. Picture found at a yard sale, flea market, purchased for $2.50, which behind it had an original copy of the Constitution of the United States, worth a million dollars,</p>
            <p>3. Acres of Diamonds</p>
            <p>4. A Picture by an original author worth $8000.00 found in the intake bin of a Good will store.</p>
            <p>From the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p>
            <p>Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his fee. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with t he air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built the a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seems to say like that, Who are you, Sir? Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead-drunk in the street, carried to the dukes house, washed and dressed and laid in the dukes bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince. (From Self-Reliance)</p>
            <p>Some people are born and die with their treasure still hidden inside of them, still locked away, buried beneath, the pain, the trauma, the tragedy, and the abuse of life.</p>
            <p>The mission of I Will Restore is to help you to bring forth, to give life to the buried treasure, that God, deposited in you as Spirit before the foundation of the world.</p>

Waters, the Restoration Doctors mission is to give you the tools and techniques, to discovery, define, and refine your principles, values and beliefs, so that you will get break through with the skills, tools, and techniques to fight the internal fight to take back your desired divine destiny.</p>
            <p>Some of the tools that we share with you is the tool that helps you to forgive anyone and everyone who you may harbor ill will toward, or that you may have an adversarial relationship with.</p>
            <p>Another tool helps you to rid yourself of the disease of blame and shame from your life, and to take full and complete responsibility for your life and the things that happen to you, you in effect become a co-creator with God of your personal life. You are empowered to call things that are not as though they were.</p>
            <p>Another tool helps you to find or create a community that supports your quest for your desired divine destiny.

            <p>The next tool is the 8 As of Destiny, 8 spiritual principles that when you implement these in your life, will reposition you internally, so that you can move toward, and bring forth your desired divine destiny.</p>
